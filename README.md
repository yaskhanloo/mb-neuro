# EPIC2secuTrial Stroke Data Pipeline

## 🔄 Current State

### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Basic service structure
- ✅ File reading and merging functions
- ✅ Logging framework
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Docker containerization

### What Needs Implementation:
- ❌ **Complete comparison logic** in validation service
- ❌ **Data type conversion and mapping** functions
- ❌ **Statistical analysis and reporting** 
- ❌ **Monthly breakdown calculations**
- ❌ **Variable-level statistics**
- ❌ **Report generation** (markdown/excel outputs)

## 🚀 How to Run Current Setup

1. **Make setup script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run setup:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Test the basic setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_setup.py
   ```

4. **Run the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Get Basic Setup Running
1. Run the setup script
2. Verify Docker containers start without errors
3. Check that log files are created properly

### Step 2: Implement Missing Logic from Notebooks
Need to port these key functions from notebooks:

#### From validation notebook:
- `compare_epic_secuTrial()` - The main comparison function
- `restructure_mismatched_data()` - For report formatting
- `generate_comparison_report()` - Report generation
- All the data type conversion and mapping logic

#### From import notebook:
- Complete `create_import_file()` implementation
- Value mapping dictionaries
- Data type conversion functions

### Step 3: Configure Logging Properly
- Define what specific logs I want
- Set up structured logging for different components
- Configure log rotation and retention

### Step 4: Database Integration
- Design database schema
- Implement database connections
- Replace CSV/Excel operations with database operations

## 🎯 Priority Tasks

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do Next):
1. **Test current setup** - Make sure containers run
2. **Port comparison logic** from validation notebook
3. **Port import logic** from import notebook
4. **Test with sample data**

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1. Implement comprehensive logging
2. Add error recovery mechanisms
3. Optimize performance

### LOW PRIORITY:
1. Database integration
2. Advanced reporting features
3. Monitoring and alerting

## 🤔 Questions for You

1. **Which notebook functions are most critical** to port first?
2. **What specific log information** do you need for your reviewers?
3. **Do you have sample data** we can use for testing?
4. **What database system** do you want to use (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)?
